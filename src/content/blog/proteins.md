#### why does my body need proteins ?
Everyone, and certainly those who have been diagnosed with cancer, must consume adequate calories and appropriate amounts of protein for cellular regeneration. After all, if you don't make enough red blood cells you will feel weak and tire easily and if you don't make enough white blood cells you will have a tough time fighting off even the mildest of colds.

We need protein for growth, to repair body tissue, and to keep our immune systems healthy. When your body doesnâ€™t get enough protein, it might break down muscle for the fuel it needs. This makes it take longer to recover from illness and can lower resistance to infection.


#### how much protein should I take ?
Most healthy adults need between 45 and 60 grams of complete protein per day, which should account for 10 to 15 percent of their daily caloric intake. Adjustments may need to be made for specific disease states. Check with your nutritionist to see what your protein requirements are.


#### what all has proteins ?
Good sources of protein include fish, poultry, lean red meat, eggs, low-fat dairy products, nuts and nut butters, dried beans, peas and lentils, and soy foods.
