### Healthy eating for cancer patients

- Eating five to nine servings daily of fruits and vegetables free of pesticides.
- Including plenty of fiber in your diet.
- Researchers have known for some time that
this general pattern of eating provides vitamins, minerals, and protective and naturally-occurring plant substances known as phytochemicals (phyto = plant) and can help to defend the body against cancer and other diseases.
- Eat at least five portions/servings of a variety of non-starchy vegetables and fruits every day. Examples of a serving: 1 cup raw or cooked vegetables or 1 medium apple.

**Essential Vitamins and Minerals**
- Calcium
- Magnesium
- B12
- Iron
- Zinc
- Vitamin E


**Fibers**

Consuming the National Cancer Institute's recommended 35 grams of fiber per day will help you to:

+ Decrease any inflammatory bowel disease flare-ups.
+ Normalize your serum cholesterol levels.
+ Stabilize your blood sugar levels.
+ Promote weight loss by creating a feeling of fullness.
+ Speed up elimination and regulate your bowel habits.
+ Decrease your risk of breast, colon, esophagus, mouth, ovarian, pharnyx, rectum, stomach and prostate cancers.
+ Reduce and/or absorb cancer causing toxins.
+ Prevent the binding of estrogen to estrogen-dependent tumors.

Soluble fibers dissolve in water and are classified as pectins, gums and mucilages. This type of fiber is found in apples, carrots, oats, barley and legumes (lentils, beans and peas). Insoluble fibers do not dissolve in water and are classified as lignins, celluloses and hemicelluloses. This type of fiber is found in stringy and cruciferous vegetables, potatoes, fruits with connective tissues or seeds, wheat bran, brown rice and flax seeds.

These two types of fiber have different health benefits. For example, foods containing soluble fiber are used to promote weight loss, reduce cholesterol levels, stabilize blood sugar and speed up bile acid secretions. This type of fiber also tends to produce more gas and intestinal discomfort when eaten in significant amounts. Foods that contain insoluble fiber speed up bowel elimination processes, improve bowel function and reduce bacterial toxin build-up. This type of fiber also reduces the absorption of certain minerals. Consuming a variety of foods, including those containing soluble and insoluble fiber, will best serve all your health needs.

**How to add fiber to your diet**

+ Start slowly. Gradually move from low fiber to high fiber food items. If you progress too quickly, your digestive tract will let you know by causing uncomfortable gas, bloating and cramping.

+ Drink fluids. You must drink more fluids with fiber rich foods, otherwise you could end up with terrible constipation. Remember, adequate water is necessary to help bulk up the stool for easy passage through the colon.
+ Go for the grains. Eat brown rice instead of white rice; whole grain flour instead of white. Choose crackers, cereals and breads that contain whole grains like wheat, rye, buckwheat, oats, quinoa, millet or amaranth. Remember that whole grains are more perishable than refined grains because of the oil in the germ. They are best stored in a cool, dry place.

+ Crunch that produce. Choose fruits and vegetables with edible skins and seeds. Raw, whole foods will contain the most fiber, but you still can derive fiber from frozen or canned produce. Juice usually contains very little fiber.

+ Lunch on some legumes. Dried beans and peas may cause some intestinal gas if you aren't used to eating them. Lentils, split peas and lima beans are most easily digested. Work up to navy, pinto, kidney or black beans and peas. + Taking digestive enzymes with your meals can help reduce much of the bloating and gas.

+ Remember to replace. Adding high fiber foods to your diet can cause you to gain weight if you use them as an addition, rather than as a substitution, for low fiber foods.

#### High-calorie foods

> For some people, it can be difficult to get enough calories to stay strong during cancer treatment. If you need to concentrate on keeping your weight up, here are some healthy, high-calorie foods.

**Fruits**

Bananas, cherries, canned fruit in juice, currants and raisins, dates and figs, fruit juices, fruit juice bars, mangoes, pineapple, plantains, dried fruits, breads/cereals

All-bran, bran-buds, breads (heavy, dense), fruitful-bran, fruit squares, low-fat granola, pasta, rice and barley, wheat germ (mix in food), cooked cereals (i.e. bulgar, grits, oatmeal, etc.)

**Vegetables**

Corn, lima beans, parsnips, peas, potatoes, succotash, sweet potatoes, winter squash (i.e. acorn, butternut)

**Dairy**

Nonfat cheese, nonfat dry milk (mix into food), nonfat frozen desserts, soy milk, nonfat frozen yogurt

**Meats and meat substitutes**

+ Beans (garbanzo, kidney, navy, pinto, etc.)
+ Fish (bluefish, butterfish, chubb, herring, mackerel, pompano, salmon, sardines, swordfish, tuna)
+ Textured vegetable protein
+ Tofu

#### Super foods

Super foods are foods that have high nutritional values, and are just plain good for you. These super foods can help you stay nourished during treatment, and may help prevent cancer.

**Yogurt**

Scientists have found that the active culture of bacteria in yogurt, which is called Lactobacillus, actually helps to fortify the immune system. Studies have shown that the use of yogurt in the diet triples the internal production of interferon which the immune system uses against tumor cells. Yogurt has also been shown to raise the level of natural killer cells. Yogurt has also been proven to slow down the growth of tumor cells in the GI tract and is able to improve the immune system's ability to destroy active tumor cells. Choose brands that state “contains live and active cultures” on the package. Avoid sweetened yogurt due to the high sugar content.

**Garlic**

Garlic has been found to stimulate natural protection against tumor cells. It has been discovered that garlic is toxic to invading pathogens and tumor cells; however, it is harmless to normal, healthy cells.

**Carotenoids**

Carotenoids and bioflavonoids absorb dangerous particles. They have the potential to stimulate the immune system. There is some evidence that both of these may be toxic to tumor cells. Carotenoids can be found in green and orange fruits and vegetables. Bioflavonoids are found in citrus, whole grains, honey and other plant foods.

**Cruciferous vegetables**

Broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage and cauliflower all have an active ingredient called “indoles” which have been proven to be protective against cancer. These vegetables are able to increase the body’s production of important protective enzymes.

**Legumes**

Also known as seed foods. These foods have a unique ability to envelop tumor cells and prevent their growth.

**Others**

Apples, apricots, barley, citrus fruit, cranberries, fiber, figs, fish oil, fish, ginger, green tea, spinach and seaweed have the ability to slow tumor growth in various ways.
