[Internation center FAQ](http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/guide-to-md-anderson/international-center/frequently-asked-questions/index.html)


### Getting the first appointment
**To make your first appointment**

Call: 001-713-745-0450
E-mail: international@mdanderson.org
Appointment form: [Request an Appointment](https://www2.mdanderson.org/sapp/contact/selfreferral/index.cfm)

A dedicated International Patient Assistant will contact you to gather:
- Contact information, language spoken, country traveling from, etc.
- Medical reports
- Imaging and pathology (depending on diagnosis)

After your information is received, the International Patient Assistant will submit it to the appropriate medical team for review and to determine the best specialist to care for you. Once an appointment has been granted, the International Patient Assistant will provide you with the appointment details and other helpful information, such as what to expect on your first day.

Appointment times will vary depending on the diagnosis, however please be assured the soonest available appointment will be offered. We do not recommend that you travel prior to confirming an appointment.


**Diagnosis and Second Opinion**

A second opinion surgical pathology case review is available to any attending physician or pathologist who submits pathology material for consultation. The submitted material will be reviewed by an in-house pathologist with expertise in that subspecialty. Very often, multiple pathologists in conference review the submitted materials. A written reply will be sent in each case.

+ The attending physician may request the necessary materials from the outside hospital or laboratory.

+ Pathologists requesting a second opinion may send the surgical material directly to us. The minimum charge for a consultation and report on referred slides prepared elsewhere is $272.  Any additional testing that is necessary to render a diagnosis will be charged in addition to this fee.

### Visa information
Once you have been accepted as a patient,

**You will receive a packet of information that includes a visa letter from your International Patient Assistant. This document verifies your appointment at MD Anderson and estimates the time needed for your initial evaluation and treatment. This letter must be taken to a U.S. embassy or consulate when you apply for a visa.**

**The International Center at MD Anderson strongly recommends that you obtain a B1 or B2 visa in case there is a need to change or extend your stay, which is always possible.** The initial trip to MD Anderson may only require a short stay, but it is important to have the necessary flexibility to stay longer once treatment is recommended. The B1 (business) and B2 (pleasure) visa provide this flexibility when traveling to the United States for medical reasons. Under a B1 or B2 visa, the initial period of stay may be granted for up to a six-month period based on your I-94 status granted by the immigration officials upon arrival and can be extended for a fee.

Please also note that your **I-94 application, which will be completed upon arrival, requires a specific address, including street name and number of any hotel or residence, in order to be processed quickly.** Without this specific information your airport arrival can be extended for several hours.

Be aware that **all travelers to the United States must have a machine-readable passport, even those passport holders that may travel without a visa under the visa waiver program.** This includes all categories of passports - regular, diplomatic and official, when the traveler is seeking to enter the U.S. for business or tourist purposes, for a maximum of 90 days.

To insure that international patients, family members, and caretakers receive immigration services from qualified and expert professionals in the field of immigration law, a list of Houston-based law firms specializing in immigration law and have agreed to serve our international patient population may be provided upon request. All of the law firms have agreed to schedule the earliest possible appointment for internationals seeking their services and fully understand that the visa application fee and attorney fees will be paid directly to the law firm by the international patient, family members, or caretakers seeking their services.



**Preparing for your appointment**

individuals.

#### Billing components

MD Anderson’s patient statements contain **two separate billing components.**

+ Hospital charges are for the use of hospital facilities and the services provided by the nurses and other members of your care team who are not physicians.

+ Physician charges represent the specialized services that your physicians will provide.

#### Cost estimations

**Initial Deposit for Evaluation**

If you are paying for your own care, you will be asked to pay an initial deposit to be evaluated at MD Anderson. This deposit is determined by the care center based on the type of cancer for which you are being seen. This deposit represents the average charge for evaluation by your physician, as well as the diagnostic tests that are normally performed in order to make a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan. The deposit is an estimate only. Actual charges may be higher or lower based on your specific needs.

MD Anderson deposit amounts include charges for both hospital and physician services. Other hospitals may provide only hospital charges, so if you are comparing charges at other institutions, you will want to ask for physician charges as well. Please speak to your International Patient Assistant if you need clarification. Our intent is to make sure you are aware of what the total estimated cost of your evaluation may be in advance.


If you wish to have a family member assist you, please complete an Authorization for Disclosure of Financial Information form so that we will be able to release financial information to that person.

**Discounts for Uninsured Patients**

If you are paying for your own care, your charges may be eligible for a discount. In order for a discount to be considered, your charge estimates must be paid in advance and any billed amounts must be paid timely. Accounts that are in collections are not eligible for a discount. Your Patient Access Specialist is available to review your account and advise you about any potential discounts.
