#### what you should do.

+ DO drink water. It may be bland next to Coke, Pepsi and coffee, but the cells in your body don’t think so. Water is the most essential nutrient for them. Try adding lemon or lime slices for flavor.

+ Eat several small snacks throughout the day, rather than 3 large meals.

+ Eat your favorite foods at any time of the day. For example, eat breakfast foods for dinner if they appeal to you.

+ Eat every few hours. Don’t wait until you feel hungry.

+ Exercise lightly or take a walk before meals to increase your appetite.

+ Drink high-calorie, high-protein beverages like milk shakes and canned liquid supplements.

+ Drink most of your fluids between meals instead of with meals. Drinking fluid with meals can make you feel too full.



+ DO eat “mixed” food for breakfast such as those containing a little carbohydrate, a little protein and a little fat. For example: Eggs and a bowl of fruit or a protein shake with soy milk and a banana.

+ DO eat less fat. The average American eats the equivalent of a stick of margarine a day, most of which is hidden in processed foods. Some examples are club crackers, frozen pot pies, potato chips, pastries such as doughnuts and croissants, and snack cakes. Of the fat you do eat, consumer a higher proportion from plant oils like olive oil and canola oil.

+ DO increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Daily “detoxing” of the colon is important in maintaining good health. There are many high fiber pills, wafers, crackers and powders that are so easy to work into a busy lifestyle. High-quality fibers such as psyllium seed, psyllium husk, oat bran, mucilages, gums and pectin should be found on the label of the product you choose. Remember to drink more water while increasing fiber in your diet.

+ DO eat nutrient dense foods everyday. Regularly consume yogurt, deep orange vegetables (carrots, squash, sweet potatoes), vegetables in the cabbage family, tomatoes, citrus fruit and dark green leafy vegetables. Remember to go for the color. The deeper the color of fruit or veggie, the more nutrients.


#### what you should not do.

+ DON’T rely on pills for nutrition. Taking one-a-day with a Wendy’s triple and large fries just isn’t going to cut it. Supplements should be taken with good food, not instead of good food.

+ DON’T walk around dehydrated. If your urine is deep in color or has a strong odor, you need to drink more water.

+ DON’T eat sugary foods in the morning. A burst of refined sugar on an empty stomach will trigger a flood of insulin which will suppress the immune system, and feed any abnormal cells which are common in everyone’s body.

+ DON’T eat daily amounts of corn oil and soybean oil, especially if hydrogenated. These fats are immune suppressive and researchers are linking hydrogenated fats to increased free radicals (destructive to cells). Butter is a better choice than margarine.

+ DON’T expect to get more fiber by eating iceberg or head lettuce, it has miniscule amounts of fiber. The same with white grapes, corn, cucumbers and celery. Some quick, simple high-fiber foods are dried figs, bananas, raisins, prunes, fresh oranges and dried dates – a good substitute for a candy bar.
