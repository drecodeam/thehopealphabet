##SIDE EFFECTS AND CURE

**Bitter or Metallic taste**

Cancer and its treatments can change your senses of taste and smell. These changes can affect your appetite and are often described as a bitter or metallic taste.

- Try sugar-free lemon drops, gum, or mints.
- Counter a salty taste with added sweeteners, sweet taste with added lemon juice and salt, and bitter taste with added sweeteners.
- Rinse your mouth with baking soda and salt mouthwash before eating to help foods taste better. (Mix 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon baking soda in 1 quart water. Shake well before swishing and spitting.)


**Swallowing problems**

**WHY**

A common side effect of certain chemotherapy agents or radiation therapy to the mouth and throat is an inflammation of the mucus membranes that line the mouth and throat. This condition is called mucositis and it can make it difficult to eat and swallow.


- Gelatin: Use to help soften cakes, cookies, crackers, sandwiches, pureed fruits, and other cold food. Mix 1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin in 2 cups hot liquid until dissolved; pour over food. Allow food to sit until saturated.


**Mouth or throat pain or sores**
- Avoid tart, acidic, or salty foods, as well as pickled and vinegary foods, tomato-based foods, and some canned broths.
- Drink through a straw to bypass mouth sores.
